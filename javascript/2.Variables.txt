###  Notes:

1. Var vs Let vs Const keywords for declaring variables:

~ Var: is old way (es6), it's legacy & always should be avoided.  Let & Const are Modern Javascript.

~ Let: variables value & data type can change later. It is also used for empty variables (Undefined, null).
	let have block scope. let cannot be redeclared on SAME scope. let can be reassigned.

~ Const: is used for constant values & fixed data types (Immutable variable). Const cant be used for Undefined or null data types.
	 const have block scope. const cannot be redeclared, reassigned. 
	 Using const with objects/arrays, you can't reassign them, but their contents can still change.

***   It is best practice to always use const when you are sure that the value will naver change later on.  ***


2. Variable Naming rules :

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Names can begin with a letter, $ and underscore but not NUMBER.
Names are case sensitive. ( Ex: y and Y are different variables).
Reserved words cannot be used as names.


3. Some Naming Conventions:

~~~ https://www.syncfusion.com/blogs/post/top-javascript-naming-convention

Using Camel Case way =  let firstNamePerson      // This is common in javascript world

Using Underscore way =  let first_name_person

Using Uppercase in 1st letter is legal bur not recommended since this way is exclusively used in OOP.  Ex:  let Person = "Jonas"

Using All Uppercase to state that the variable is a constant. Ex:   let PI_VALUE = 3.14159                                          // Standard Practice




### Coding:

1. Declaring Variables :

let p;          	  // Variable declared but undefined
console.log(p)

let x;     
x = 5;

let x = 5;
let y = 6;

let x=5, y=6, z="ok";    	// can declare multi variables at the same line
console.log(x, y, z)

let _ = "POOP", $ = 32;   	// $ & Underscore are valid JS identifiers
console.log(_ , $);


console.log(z = "Hello World!");       // Variables can be declared in conole output
console.log(z);



2. Changing values of variables:

let x=5, y=6, z="ok";

x="yes!", y=true, z=99.9;         //JS is loosely typed, data types & values can be updated along
console.log(x, y, z)
