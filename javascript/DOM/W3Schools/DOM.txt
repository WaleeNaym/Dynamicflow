in JS context, DOM is a JavaScript Object{}, that represents the page you see in the browser and provides you with an API to Interact with it.
Web browser constructs the DOM when it loads an HTML document, and structures all the elements in a tree like representation.
JavaScript can access the DOM dynamically. Change the content, structure, style of a web page.


Pillars of DOM :
`Selection of an Element
`Changing HTML
`Changing CSS
`Event Listener


# What JS can do with DOM:
JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page


# What is DOM:
The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard. The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows 
programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document.

The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:

Core DOM - standard model for all document types
XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents


# What is the HTML DOM?
The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:

The HTML elements as objects
The properties of all HTML elements
The methods to access all HTML elements
The events for all HTML elements


# HTML DOM Methods :

`HTML DOM methods are actions you can perform (on HTML Elements).
`HTML DOM properties are values (of HTML Elements) that you can set or change.


# The DOM Programming Interface: 

The HTML DOM can be accessed with JavaScript (and with other programming languages).
In the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as objects.
The programming interface is the properties and methods of each object.
A property is a value that you can get or set (like changing the content of an HTML element).
A method is an action you can do (like add or deleting an HTML element).



# HTML DOM Document :
The HTML DOM document object is the owner of all other objects in your web page.
The document object represents your web page.
If you want to access any element in an HTML page, you always start with accessing the document object.

Some examples of how you can use the document object to access and manipulate HTML:

`Finding HTML Elements:

document.getElementById(id)		Find an element by element id
document.getElementsByTagName(name)	Find elements by tag name
document.getElementsByClassName(name)	Find elements by class name


`Changing HTML Elements: (using methods or properties)

element.innerHTML =  new html content	Change the inner HTML of an element
element.attribute = new value		Change the attribute valuew of an HTML element
element.style.property = new style	Change the style of an HTML element

element.setAttribute(attribute, value)	Change the attribute value of an HTML element  [This is a method, not property]


`Adding and Deleting Element: (Mostly Methods)

document.createElement(element)		Create an HTML element
document.removeChild(element)		Remove an HTML element
document.appendChild(element)		Add an HTML element
document.replaceChild(new, old)		Replace an HTML element
document.write(text)			Write into the HTML output stream


`Adding Events Handlers: (Method)

document.getElementById(id).onclick = function(){code}		Adding event handler code to an onclick event
