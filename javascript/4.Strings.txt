### Notes:

A String is a sequence or array of characters. 
They can be inside single quote, double quotes or backticks. 
Each character of string can be accessed using index, each can be assigned to variables.




### Code:

1. String Declaration :

let name1 = 'Walee';
let name2 = "Naym";
let greeting = `Whats's Up`;       	 //Backticks
console.log(name1, name2, greeting);



2. Quotes Inside Quotes:  (Combination of single, double qutes & backticks can be used)

let var1 = " It's alright 'Johny' ";
let var2 = ' It"s alright "Johny" & `Tommy` ';
let var3 = ` It's alright "Johny" & 'Tommy' `; 



3. String Template or Template Literals:

// Template strings or literals use ` Backticks ` to define a string. 
// They allow single & double quotes inside them. 
// They allow multiline strings.
// It is a way to create strings that allow for easy embedding of expressions or variables within them.


let bool1 = true;
let num1 = 38.5;
let str_template01 = `Multiple values stored inside as string: ${num1}, ${bool1} `;
console.log(typeof str_template01);



4. String Interpolation:

// The process of assigning variables and expressions inside the template literal is known as interpolation.

let name1 = "Naym";
let birth = 1999;
let Str_Interpolation = ` My name is ${name1}, my birthdate is ${birth} `;

console.log(Str_Interpolation);

console.log(` My name is ${name1}, my birthdate is ${birth} `);



5. Multi-line String:

console.log(" This is line 1     \n\
This is line 2 ");                       // Using single or double Quotes
	
console.log(` This is line 1
this is line 2 `);                       // using BackTicks

console.log( "This is line 1"  +
'This is line 2' );                       // using + Operator

console.log( "This is line 1"  /
'This is line 2' );                       // using / Operator 



7. String Concatenation using (+) operator:

const firstName = "Walee"
const lastName = "Naym"
console.log(firstName + " " + lastName)



8. length property:

let text = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
let length01 = text.length;			//To find the length of a string.

console.log(length01);



9. Escape characters: 

//Escape characters are not rendered by html & browsers, They are only for console.

let text1 = "We are the \"Vikings\" from the north.";       //Insert Double Quote

let text2 = 'It\'s alright.';                           //Insert Single quote

let text3 = "The character \\ is called backslash.";     //Insert single Backlash

let text4 = "ok \n ok"              			  //New line
