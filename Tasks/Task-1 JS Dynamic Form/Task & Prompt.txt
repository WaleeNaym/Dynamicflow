### Prompt :

Make me a dynamic form: 

Instructions:
have html, css, javascript files separate.  
Use as simplified javascript code as possible.
Use javascript onclick & onchange events. Use other events if required.
Use bare minimum css if required.

Features:
~Overall there will be two sections left & right side. (No need for border)
~The left side will have the form & right side will show dynamic output.
~No need to have any submit button.

1. leftside: Name input field. rightside: dynamically output whatever user types 
2. leftside: Gender Checkbox. Checkbox options: Male, Female, Others.
	*If only "Others" option is selected,
	*An input box will appear on rightside (Don't add any button)
3.Leftside: Department Selection. Selection options: CSE, EEE, Economics.
	*Whichever selection is selected, Show it to the right side.

Update:
1. Add a reset button to the "left". 
	*Clicking the button will show javascript confirm() box, With message "Are you sure to reset ?"
	* If "ok" is clicked Everything will reset
	* If "cancel" nothing will change
