7. php constants:

A constant is a name for a fixed value that cannot be changed after it's defined.
Unlike variables, constants do not start with $.
Constants are global and accessible anywhere in the script.


# Create php constants:

`One way is to create a constant, use the define() function.

Syntax:      define(name, value);

name: Specifies the name of the constant
value: Specifies the value of the constant

`Declare and print constant:

define("demo_var_01", "Welcome to my site!");
echo demo_var_01;


`Another way to create a constant by using the const keyword.

const MYCAR = "Volvo";
echo MYCAR;



8. php magic constants: 

Special constants with double underscores (__) before and after the name.
Their values change depending on where they are used.


| Constant        | Description                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `__LINE__`      | Current line number in the file |
| `__FILE__`      | Full path and filename          |
| `__DIR__`       | Directory of the file           |
| `__FUNCTION__`  | Name of the current function    |
| `__CLASS__`     | Name of the current class       |
| `__METHOD__`    | Name of the class method        |
| `__NAMESPACE__` | Name of the current namespace   |

Ex:

<?php
echo __LINE__;     // Outputs current line number
echo __FILE__;     // Full path of this file
?>
