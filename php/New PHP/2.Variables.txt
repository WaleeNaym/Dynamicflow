### Notes: 


# Variable Naming rules:

`Starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable.
`Variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
`Variable name cannot start with a number.
`Can contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ). No special characters.
`Variable names are case sensitive. ($age and $Age are two different variables).


Unlike other programming languages, PHP has no command for declaring a variable (Var, Let). It is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

php is a loosely typed language. We donâ€™t have to declare data type when assigning variables. PHP defines the variable's type based on the value assigned to it. 
However in php 7, type declaration was added.
